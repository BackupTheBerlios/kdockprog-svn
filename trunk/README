0. Introduction 
KDockProg is a small desktop tool. It was developed for KDE3 using Qt3 but also
works Gnome desktop.
Purpose of the tool is to add icons to the desktop control bar to invoke 
programs. When clicking on the icon the corresponding program is executed. 
Then the icon changes to a new icon invoking a different program etc.
Main purpose for this tool is to install a toggling icon executing two 
different programs that e.g. start/stop something.

1. Compile
The version published here uses a simple Makefile which you probably have to
configure before compiling. You need Qt3 and KDE3 development packages.
The variable QTDIR is set to /usr/lib/qt3 and KDEDIR is set to /opt/kde3.
If those two are set to your paths just enter
  make
in your shell. This will compile,link, and strip the tool.
If you need an unstripped version with debug information, type
  make debug
instead.

2. Install
Copy the tool kdockprog to your PATH (e.g. /opt/kde3/bin) and make sure it is
executable.
  sudo install -m 755 kdockprog /opt/kde3/bin/

3. Invoke
Usage is very simple:
  kdockprog -i <icon> -e <command> [[-i <icon>] -e <command> [..]]
So you invoke kdockprog giving the path to an icon and a corresponding command
line to execute. Then you may add a second icon with a second command, and if
you wish a third and so on.

Example 1: Sleep and wake up processes
  ICONDIR=/opt/kde3/share/icons/crystalsvg/22x22/actions
  APPS="firefox-bin firefox kpdf"
  kdockprog -i $ICONDIR/stop.png -e "killall -19 $APPS" -i $ICONDIR/reload.png -e "killall -18 $APPS" &
This small example installs a stop-icon on the control bar. If you click on it,
two things happen:
  1. the SIGSTOP signal is sent to all processes firefox-bin, firefox, and kpdf 
putting them to sleep.
  2. the icon changes itself to the reload-icon.
If you then click on the reload-icon the signal SIGCONT is sent to the 
processes waking them up and the icon again changes to the stop-icon.

Example 2: Buttons for Amarok
  ICONDIR=/opt/kde3/share/icons/crystalsvg/22x22/actions
  kdockprog -i $ICONDIR/player_pause.png -e "dcop amarok player pause" -i $ICONDIR/player_play.png -e "dcop amarok player play" &
  kdockprog -i $ICONDIR/player_end.png -e "dcop amarok player next" &
Here two icons are installed on the control bar. The first one is a pause-icon
sending a pause message via dcop to Amarok and then changes to a play-icon, 
which sends a play message to Amarok.
The second icon is very simple. It just displays the forward-icon sending a 
next message to Amarok.

I installed both sets of lines in a small script into my ~/.kde3/Autostart 
folder.
